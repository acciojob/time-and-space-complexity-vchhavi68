	<h1> Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time Complexity refers to how the running time of an algorithm increases as the input size grows. 
        It helps us understand whether an algorithm is efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
        Space Complexity focuses on the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size increases. 
        It helps measure how efficiently an algorithm uses memory. 
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is often written using Big O notation such as O(n).
