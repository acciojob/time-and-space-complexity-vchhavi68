		Time, Space, Complexity
	</h1>
	<p>
		An efficient algorithm is one that completes its task in a relatively short amount of time, especially when dealing with large inputs. Time complexity helps quantify this efficiency.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space complexity,</b> O(n), also known as linear space complexity, indicates that the amount of memory an algorithm uses grows directly in proportion to the size of its input, denoted by 'n'.
