		Time, Space, Complexity
	</h1>
	<p>
	  Time complexity is a measure of an algorithm's efficiency in terms of the amount of time it takes to run as a function of the size of its input. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space complexity,</b> O(n), also known as linear space complexity, indicates that the amount of memory an algorithm uses grows directly in proportion to the size of its input, denoted by 'n'.
